#### [Loading Testing API's with JMeter: CMD Tools](/blog/load-testing-apis-jmeter-cmd)

###### [#api]() [#jmeter]()
On the [previous](/blog/load-testing-apis-jmeter-gui) article, we saw how to setup JMeter with GUI mode. Although the GUI mode is a poweful tool for configuring and debugging your tests, it's a poor choice when it comes to load testing. On this entry, we will look at how we can use the command-line tools to stress our API, and then use the JMeter GUI mode to interprete the results.

You have developed a shiny API that you are proud of, but you don't know how it will handle real life traffic? This is always a concern for any developer, but you can ease some of these worries by stress testing your API. There are many tools out there for loading testing API's but perhaps the most popular is [Apache's JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)

There are a couple of microservice frameworks available for Node.js platform. The 3 most known would be [Cote](https://cote.com), [Moleculer](https://moleculer) and [Seneca](https://seneca.com). For this part series, I will be exploring [Microservices](https://) in Node.js platform using Moleculer.

Can you really send an email from Javascript (React) without a backend server? Well, you could.. sort of. In my quest of building a [server-less]() blog, I went looking
for a mailing solution that didn't require a server setup. What I found was [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/).

With a multitude of testing framework available for JavaScript and Node.js in specific, it can quickly become overwhelming. For the seasoned, the choices usually narrows down to [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) paired with assertion library like [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/). Although Mocha can also be used for testing on the browser side, I have found having a uniform test framework across the Node.js and browser (React) environment to be more rewarding, and thereâ€™s no other choice that can rival [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). The beauty of Jest is the out-of-the-box support on React and zero configuration almost elsewhere

###### [#react]() [#hooks]()
React hooks is a god's sent feature that was introduced in React 16.8. In old days, if your component did not handle any local state, then you would normally write it as a stateless functional component. Simple and elegant. Now the problem came if you decided to introduce state to the said component. You would need to refactor your functional component to a class based component to enjoy the state & the lifecycles. Now with the Hook API, you can easily use state, introduce side effects and so much more. React provides a handful of hooks, but the most widely used are:-

#### [React Testing: Mocking axios with axios-mock-adapter](/blog/axios-mocking)

###### [#react]() [#axios]() [#axios-mock-adapter]()
Unless you fancy the built-in `fetch` API, chances are that you are using or have used axios as your HTTP client. If so, when writing tests you may need to mock API requests. You could of course use mock functions provided by your test library in this case Jest, but I have found a nifty package called `axios-mock-adapter` to be excellent and natural when testing codes with axios implementation.

So, some days back I went looking for the best Low Fidelify sounds aka *Lo-fi* beats. (I am lover of lofi, if can't tell already and do enjoy them especially 
when coding). Fist, I wanted to know more about their origin and was suprised that they go way back to 50's. I will not bother you will all the history, but 
here is a nice [entry in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music) you can read. I didn't know Lo-fi is a *music quality* in which
