We all know of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), but there exists another form of social responsibility called Individual/Personal Social Responsibilty (PSR). 
It's defined as the primary responsibility of an individual toward family, workplace, community, and environment (both ecological and social). 
[See this entry from Jayashree](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personal-social-responsibility-psr-jayashree-venugopala). As developer, 
I see this as a call to build a solution/software that is free, easily acessible and relevant. It's with this philosophy that I decided to an 
application that could immortalize the wisdom of the Agikuyu people. Here is my effort to create a collection of 1000 Kikuyu proverbs, based on G. Barra book of the 
same title.
