We all know of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), but there exists another form of social responsibility called Individual/Personal Social Responsibilty (PSR). 
It's defined as the primary responsibility of an individual toward family, workplace, community, and environment. 
[See this entry from Jayashree](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personal-social-responsibility-psr-jayashree-venugopala). As developer, 
I see this as a call to build a solution/software that is free, easily acessible and relevant. It's with this philosophy that I decided to an 
application that could immortalize the wisdom of the Agĩkũyũ people. Here is my effort to create a collection of 1000 Kikuyu proverbs, based on G. Barra book of the 
same title.
*For the Kikuyu people, please note the work on accenting the proverbs with the Kikuyu vowels is ongoing and the entries will be updated as soon as the work is complete*
