You have developed a shiny API that you are proud of, but you don't know how it will handle the real life traffic? This is always a concern for any developer, but you can ease some of these worries by stress testing your API. There are many tools out there for loading testing API's but perhaps the most popular is [Apache's JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/). From their website:-
> The Apache JMeterâ„¢ application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions.
JMeter can be used to test performance on both static &amp; dynamic resources, by simulating heavy load on the material server/resource.

###### Ok. Let's do this

Head over to [download](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) section of JMeter &amp; download it. You will need to have Java 8+ installed to run the latest version. Uncompress and launch the JMeter.
It will create a test case that you can rename or leave it as is.
