You have developed a shiny API that you are proud of, but you don't know how it will handle real life traffic? This is always a concern for any developer, but you can ease some of these worries by stress testing your API. There are many tools out there for loading testing API's but perhaps the most popular is [Apache's JMeter]. From their website:-
> The Apache JMeterâ„¢ application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions.
