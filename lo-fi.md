So, some days back I went looking for the best Low Fidelify sounds aka *Lo-fi* beats. (I am lover of lo-fi, if you can't tell already and do enjoy them especially 
when coding). Fist, I wanted to know more about their origin and was suprised that they go way back to 50's. I will not bother you will all the history, but 
here is a nice [entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music) in Wikipedia that you can read. There's one aspect of Lo-fi though, that has always bothered me:- Those strange
random noise/voices. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music)

> Lo-fi is a *music quality* in which elements usually regarded as *imperfections* of a recording or performance are *audible*, 
> sometimes as a *deliberate* aesthetic choice. 

Mmmh, ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€. I see. Now that's settled, let's look at the list that I compiled.

###### 1. [ChilledCow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A)
Perhaps, the most popular &amp; known 24/7 lo-fi beats streamer on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A). They have been around since 2005 playing the best of lo-fi there is. They have a wide collection of beats to power your coding sessions. They are also on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/chilledcow) which is more convinient when on the move. They are also on Spotify &amp; Apple Music.
They do have another channel [beats to sleep/chill to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWcJFNfaw9c) for the insomniacs. From their page, this is what they say about it:
> Welcome to the sleepy lofi hip hop radio. This playlist contains the smoothest lofi hip hop beats, perfect to help you chill or fall asleep ðŸ’¤

###### 2. [Chillhop](https://chillhop.com/)
Like Chilledcow, [Chillhop](https://chillhop.com/) has a 24/7 stream on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU). They are old-timers too, with accounts on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/chillhopdotcom), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/chillhopmusic) &amp; [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/nl/playlist/lofi-hip-hop-beats-music-to-study-relax-to-lo-fi-chill-hop/pl.7f6bab5a94ca460c9692cb424447a7d1). You can also stream lo-fi beats directly from their [website](https://chillhop.com/), and use it on your content with attribution. See thier terms [here](https://chillhop.com/creators/).
They have a [jazzy & lofi hip hop beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yx6BWlEVcY) channel for jaz/zzy audience.

###### 3. [Lo-fi Radio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peakpocketstudios.lofiradio) 
This is quite a different one. It's an android app that has a good selection of Lo-fi beats although not as good as the two above. You can download it on the [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peakpocketstudios.lofiradio).
