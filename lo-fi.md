So, some days back I went looking for the best Low Fidelify sounds aka *Lo-fi* beats. (I am lover of lofi, if can't tell already and do enjoy them especially 
when coding). Fist, I wanted to know more about their origin and was suprised that they go way back to 50's. I will not bother you will all the history, but 
here is a nice [entry in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music) you can read. There's one aspect of Lo-fi that has always bothered me:- The strange
random voices. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music)

> Lo-fi is a *music quality* in which elements usually regarded as *imperfections* of a recording or performance are *audible*, 
> sometimes as a *deliberate* aesthetic choice. 

I have always wondered about this phenomenon, and now that it's clear, we may proceed.
#### To the beats please..
