So, some days back I went looking for the best Low Fidelify sounds aka *Lo-fi* beats. (I am lover of lo-fi, if you can't tell already and do enjoy them especially 
when coding). Fist, I wanted to know more about their origin and was suprised that they go way back to 50's. I will not bother you will all the history, but 
here is a nice [entry in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music) that you can read. There's one aspect of Lo-fi that has always bothered me:- Those strange
random noise/voices. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music)

> Lo-fi is a *music quality* in which elements usually regarded as *imperfections* of a recording or performance are *audible*, 
> sometimes as a *deliberate* aesthetic choice. 

Mmmh, :grinning:. I see. Now that's settled, let's proceed.
